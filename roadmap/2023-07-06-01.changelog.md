**Define channels for the application boundary**

We define a "channel" as a function that:

- takes a single argument as input
- logs its input
- validates its input
- reports input validation failure
- passes the validated input to a function
- reports function failure
- validates the function output
- reports function output validation failure
- logs the output
- returns the output

Our goal is to have the boundary of our application completely defined via channels.
