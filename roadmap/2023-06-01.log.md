# Open Questions

- We probably want to add the same kind of dev env bootstrap that we used in the
  robot repo. Or do we?

- What do we want to use for the list of addresses to boot? It really could just
  be a text file in a volume. That's probably easier than using a database.

- Look into Sentry reporting and figure out what keys-values we need to use in
  the event publishing.

# Resolutions

## Boot a cluster of XMTP clients

- A list of N addresses to boot is in a database
- We use the `--scale` docker compose flag to run N instances of the XMTP
  client. Each of the N instances fetches an address to run from the database
  and then runs the XMTP client with that address. We need to make sure that the
  read is atomic so that we don't have two clients trying to use the same
  address.
- This means we need to add a database to the docker compose cluster. I guess we
  should use Prisma for consistency with our other projects. Actually, maybe not.
