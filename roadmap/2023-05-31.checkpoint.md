# Active Development

- bootstrap dev environment
- docker compose file
- The services in the docker compose cluster are a bunch of XMTP clients
- Each XMTP client listens for messages and calls a message handler
- The message handler should:
  - filter messages it doesn't want to handle
  - validate message payloads
  - log the message
  - call an HTTP API
  - log the response
  - send a response message to the XMTP server
